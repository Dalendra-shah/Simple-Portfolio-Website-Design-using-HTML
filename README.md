# Simple Portfolio Website Design using HTML
Creating a portfolio website is a great way to showcase your work, skills, and personal brand to companies/recruiters. Let's create a simple portfolio using only HTML
We'll develop a simple portfolio website that presents your professional highlights, projects, and achievements. We'll utilize HTML tables to organize content, and the layout will be clean with text alignments and a navigational header.

You are not required to style the website, you are only required to create the structure of the website using HTML.
